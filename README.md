## Challenge #1 - Unstoppable
There’s a tokenized vault with a million DVT tokens deposited. It’s offering flash loans for free, until the grace period ends.

To pass the challenge, make the vault stop offering flash loans.

You start with 10 DVT tokens in balance.

## Challenge #2 - Naive receiver
There’s a pool with 1000 ETH in balance, offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH.

A user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance. It’s capable of interacting with the pool and receiving flash loans of ETH.

Take all ETH out of the user’s contract. If possible, in a single transaction.

## Challenge #3 - Truster
More and more lending pools are offering flash loans. In this case, a new pool has launched that is offering flash loans of DVT tokens for free.

The pool holds 1 million DVT tokens. You have nothing.

To pass this challenge, take all tokens out of the pool. If possible, in a single transaction.

## Challenge #4 - Side Entrance
A surprisingly simple pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any point in time.

It has 1000 ETH in balance already, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH to promote their system.

Starting with 1 ETH in balance, pass the challenge by taking all ETH from the pool.

## Challenge #5 - The Rewarder
There’s a pool offering rewards in tokens every 5 days for those who deposit their DVT tokens into it.

Alice, Bob, Charlie and David have already deposited some DVT tokens, and have won their rewards!

You don’t have any DVT tokens. But in the upcoming round, you must claim most rewards for yourself.

By the way, rumours say a new pool has just launched. Isn’t it offering flash loans of DVT tokens?

## Challenge #6 - Selfie
A new cool lending pool has launched! It’s now offering flash loans of DVT tokens. It even includes a fancy governance mechanism to control it.

What could go wrong, right ?

You start with no DVT tokens in balance, and the pool has 1.5 million. Your goal is to take them all.
